title: "Internationalisation"

level: 5

intro: Internationalisation is still very immature and unstable, with most libraries being only weeks old and not used in production yet. Further more, other than the usual gettext approach, the rust ecosystem doesn't offer much yet. ICU is completely non-existant.


packages:
  - gettext
  - gettext-rs
  - i18n
  - l20n

missing:
 - ICU

news_tag: i18n
