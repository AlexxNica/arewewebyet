{"crate":{"created_at":"2015-11-30T16:41:44Z","description":"A brotli decompressor that with an interface avoiding the rust stdlib. This makes it suitable for embedded devices and kernels. It is designed with a pluggable allocator so that the standard lib's allocator may be employed. The default build also includes a stdlib allocator and stream interface. Disable this with --features=no-stdlib. Alternatively, --features=unsafe turns off array bounds checks and memory initialization but provides a safe interface for the caller.  Without adding the --features=unsafe argument, all included code is safe.","documentation":"https://github.com/google/brotli/tree/master/docs","downloads":6386,"homepage":"https://github.com/dropbox/rust-brotli","id":"brotli","keywords":["nostd","decompression","huffman","lz77","brotli"],"license":"BSD-3-Clause/MIT","links":{"owners":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/owners","reverse_dependencies":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/reverse_dependencies","version_downloads":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/downloads","versions":null},"max_version":"1.0.7","name":"brotli","repository":"https://github.com/dropbox/rust-brotli","updated_at":"2016-10-22T08:48:50Z","versions":[36475,28912,27609,18751]},"keywords":[{"crates_cnt":6,"created_at":"2015-11-14T07:18:57Z","id":"nostd","keyword":"nostd"},{"crates_cnt":10,"created_at":"2015-05-25T07:39:30Z","id":"decompression","keyword":"decompression"},{"crates_cnt":3,"created_at":"2016-03-14T19:54:56Z","id":"huffman","keyword":"huffman"},{"crates_cnt":2,"created_at":"2016-05-24T08:10:20Z","id":"lz77","keyword":"lz77"},{"crates_cnt":2,"created_at":"2016-05-24T08:10:20Z","id":"brotli","keyword":"brotli"}],"versions":[{"crate":"brotli","created_at":"2016-10-22T08:48:50Z","dl_path":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.7/download","downloads":68,"features":{"benchmark":[],"disable-timer":[],"no-stdlib":["alloc-no-stdlib/no-stdlib"],"seccomp":[],"unsafe":["alloc-no-stdlib/unsafe"]},"id":36475,"links":{"authors":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.7/authors","dependencies":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.7/dependencies","version_downloads":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.7/downloads"},"num":"1.0.7","updated_at":"2016-10-22T08:48:50Z","yanked":false},{"crate":"brotli","created_at":"2016-06-20T21:40:37Z","dl_path":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.6/download","downloads":6046,"features":{"benchmark":[],"disable-timer":[],"no-stdlib":["alloc-no-stdlib/no-stdlib"],"unsafe":["alloc-no-stdlib/unsafe"]},"id":28912,"links":{"authors":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.6/authors","dependencies":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.6/dependencies","version_downloads":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/1.0.6/downloads"},"num":"1.0.6","updated_at":"2016-06-20T21:40:37Z","yanked":false},{"crate":"brotli","created_at":"2016-05-24T09:00:39Z","dl_path":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.1/download","downloads":64,"features":{},"id":27609,"links":{"authors":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.1/authors","dependencies":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.1/dependencies","version_downloads":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.1/downloads"},"num":"0.1.1","updated_at":"2016-05-24T09:00:39Z","yanked":false},{"crate":"brotli","created_at":"2015-11-30T16:41:44Z","dl_path":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.0/download","downloads":208,"features":{},"id":18751,"links":{"authors":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.0/authors","dependencies":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.0/dependencies","version_downloads":"/api/v1/crates/brotli/0.1.0/downloads"},"num":"0.1.0","updated_at":"2015-12-12T23:55:19Z","yanked":false}]}
